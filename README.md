# TCWCMS
CMS for TrinityCore

TCWCMS is a web based content management system for TrinityCore, the MMORPG server framework. It is designed and built to provide an easy to use system for spinning up a website for your TrinityCore server, or cluster of servers. 

TCWCMS is built on the Laravel PHP framework, and as such has some software requirements that must be met in order to use it. 

Please check the software requirements often, as they will change as development progresses.
